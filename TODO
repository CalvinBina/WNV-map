----NOT DONE------
Comb data, find WEEKLY trends.... weekly data, weekly GIS to put into a fusion table. 

Add rainfall to the map,.... eventually go get Rainfall weekly/Monthly interactive.

----- NOT DONE (CALVIN'S RECCOMENDATIONS)----
figure out how to fine grain the data to month
    - just need to rework the scripts
    - need to provide a function that takes the spreadsheets in THAT FORMAT and automatically appends
        the data extracted to the fusion table.

add the data from TPW_FORMATTED and UPDATED_DATA_2 spreadsheets

finish up the county highlighting 
    - change it up so that there is a "None" option in the county dropdowns for the graphs
    - need to change up the method for choosing the county

fix the synchronous call for clicking the county - works alright for now

explore options for customizing graphs for data

-------DONE-----------------------------



make the interface look better, and separate the data charts and the data map
    - DONE

switch up options, move county dropdown to graphs - done

add option to display polygons for whole state, otherwise just show polygons for selected counties

use RawData/Data Separated Sheets/ T P W Formatted file 

maybe make it look better - added a background, put this on backburner

do that polygon click update thing from last week

implement multiple county options - done

look up more options for displaying graphs, maybe get it done by popping up a new tab

LAST WEEK STUFF
-------------------------------------------------
highlight county - not possible with fusion tables layer, not exposed in the API, can only apply styles to all polygons, infowindow points to county
    in other words - not feasible, unfortunately

get stations count displayed - DONE
    it is not optimal, since we are doing a synchronous ajax call to get the json data, which blocks the webpage. Might need to
    dream up a better way of doing this, but I have a feeling that it might require reworking a lot
    IDEA - maybe with updateLayerQuery, have it do the synchronous ajax call once, store the JSON data in a var? that
        way there isn't a call happening with every click

reduce totals by month - need to rework the database, and rework the scripts

multiple graph comparisons - get some divs for now, add dropdowns of county, have none option. In the future, this can have nice styles to it,
    like having it automatically center on the screen based on # of graphs, sliding animations, disappearing divs, or something like all that

get max count for styling the map by species by year (by query) - DONE, works good

get data for rainfall, temperature, and dead birds, match to time - I think i found rainfall and temp data by month by station - going to have to turn this into 
    data organized by year, and WAY more cleaned up
